      <td><p>Hello welcome to Mustafa's personal website. I am a 13 year aspiring kid who loves computer science, I genraly prefrom amazingly in school and execel in math and the sciences. Over the years I have worked on various hobies and projects however I
        think that Computer Science and web devolopement have a really good feel to it. This is my first website that is why it looks like a weird paper. Anyways recently I have picked up Java programing being my first language so for me Html, CSS and
        Java are very weird and simple but I am getting used to it as I know this will be helpful.</p>
